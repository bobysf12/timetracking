# ⏱️ CLI Time Tracker – Like a Boss in the Terminal

Welcome to your new terminal-based productivity sidekick!  
This repo helps you **track your time** and **crush your Pomodoros** with nothing but a bash script and your iron will 💪.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you start conquering your day, make sure you've installed the real MVP:

👉 [**Watson**](https://github.com/jazzband/Watson) – the time-tracking ninja that lives in your terminal.

## 🧭 How to Use

### 🕵️ General Time Tracking

Wanna track what you’re doing like a productivity detective?

Run:

```bash
./timetracking.sh "Work"
```

That’s it! You’re now tracking time for your “Work” activity. Replace `"Work"` with anything you like:

```bash
./timetracking.sh "Scrolling StackOverflow"
```

When you’re done, just hit `Ctrl + C` and Watson will log your heroic efforts.

### 🍅 Pomodoro Mode – Focus Like a Legend

Ready to *actually* do deep work in 25-minute sprints?

```bash
./timetracking-podomoro.sh "Work"
```

This will:

1. Start a 25-minute focus session for your `"Work"` activity.
2. Take a 5-minute break 🍵.
3. After every 4 Pomodoros, give you a longer 30-minute break 🏖️.
4. Repeat until you're unstoppable (or hit `Ctrl + C`).

Watson will track every focus session so you can flex later with your stats.
